Thanks to Wemja, Ergg, and Neowolf for their help creating textures.

--------

Many people have made paper cut-outs that look like objects from Minecraft, but now you can reverse that and make Minecraft look like paper cut-outs! This pack uses shading to make the textures look like cut, folded, and overlapping paper. In addition to these 3D effects, the textures also have just a little papery roughness, but not so much as to be "noisy".

Most of the important textures have been customized, and the remaining textures come from either the Minecraft defaults or from my other texture pack, BitKnit. I used BitKnit to fill in many of the incomplete textures since it blends with the style of this pack better than the default textures. If a texture appears to be customized but still looks a little out of place, it probably came from BitKnit. The BitKnit texture pack can be downloaded from: www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/bitknit


If you distribute this texture pack, please keep it in its original form and provide credit with a link to its planetminecraft page. If you wish to alter or extend the pack, please contact me via my "superalgae" account at planetminecraft.com.

Alternate Textures!

Inside the the texture pack zip file are some folders whose names start with "alt-". These can be found under the "assets/minecraft/textures/blocks" and "assets/minecraft/textures/items" folders. They contain alternate textures that you can use to replace Paper Cut-Out's default textures. For example, the folder "assets/minecraft/textures/blocks/alt-ores-square" contains the square style ores that were the default in earlier versions of Paper Cut-Out.
