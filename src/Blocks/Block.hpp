/**
 * Base class for all blocks in the game.
 * This class servers as the base class for all blocks in the game,
 * including plants which is a subclass. Most of the functions are
 * virtual functions so that they can be changed and code inserted
 * if neccessary. Every attempt will be made to make values in
 * accordance with the Minecraft Official Wiki.
 *
 * When this class is subclassed it should be added into the InitBlocks.hpp
 * file. This updates the extern GlobalBlockMap. Once the block is added
 * to the file and the game is run, it attempts to parse the Craft2/assets/blocks
 * yaml file for the block to fetch textures for building a texture atlas. If
 * a yaml file for the block doesn't exist the game will create an empty one
 * and the block will not render properly until the .yaml file is updated.
